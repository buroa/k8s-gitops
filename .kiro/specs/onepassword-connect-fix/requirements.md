# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The OnePassword Connect integration in the Kubernetes cluster has a known issue where credentials become triple base64 encoded, causing authentication failures. This feature will implement a robust solution to properly handle OnePassword Connect credentials and ensure reliable secret synchronization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a cluster administrator, I want OnePassword Connect to authenticate successfully without credential encoding issues, so that ExternalSecrets can reliably sync secrets from 1Password.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OnePassword Connect pods start THEN they SHALL authenticate successfully with properly encoded credentials
2. WHEN ExternalSecrets attempt to sync THEN they SHALL successfully retrieve secrets from 1Password vault
3. WHEN credentials are updated in bootstrap process THEN they SHALL be encoded correctly without manual intervention
4. IF credential encoding fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery instructions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a cluster administrator, I want the bootstrap process to handle OnePassword credentials correctly, so that I don't need manual workarounds after cluster deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN bootstrap secrets are generated THEN OnePassword credentials SHALL be properly encoded for Kubernetes consumption
2. WHEN using 1Password CLI output THEN the system SHALL handle pre-encoded credentials correctly
3. WHEN secrets template is applied THEN it SHALL prevent double base64 encoding
4. IF bootstrap fails THEN it SHALL provide clear troubleshooting steps

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a cluster administrator, I want automated validation of OnePassword Connect health, so that I can quickly identify and resolve authentication issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OnePassword Connect is deployed THEN health checks SHALL verify successful authentication
2. WHEN credentials are malformed THEN the system SHALL detect and report the specific encoding issue
3. WHEN ExternalSecrets fail to sync THEN diagnostic information SHALL be available
4. WHEN recovery is needed THEN automated scripts SHALL be available to fix credential encoding

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a cluster administrator, I want comprehensive documentation and tooling, so that I can maintain OnePassword Connect integration without manual credential manipulation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN troubleshooting is needed THEN documentation SHALL provide step-by-step resolution procedures
2. WHEN credentials need updating THEN automated scripts SHALL handle proper encoding
3. WHEN new team members join THEN setup documentation SHALL be clear and complete
4. WHEN issues occur THEN diagnostic commands SHALL be readily available
