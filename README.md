## üìñ Overview

This is a mono repository for my home infrastructure and Kubernetes cluster. It is deployed and managed using tools like [Talos](https://talos.dev/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2), [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

---

## ‚õµ Kubernetes

### Installation

The cluster is running on [Talos Linux](https://talos.dev), an immutable and ephemeral Linux distribution built around [Kubernetes](https://k8s.io), deployed on bare-metal [Apple Mac Mini's](https://apple.com/mac-mini). [Rook Ceph](https://rook.io) is providing my workloads with persistent block, object, and file storage; while a seperate server provides file storage for my media.

üî∏ _[Click here](./talos) to see my Talos configuration._

### Core Components

- [actions-runner-controller](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller): Self-hosted Github runners.
- [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/): Creates SSL certificates for services in my Kubernetes cluster.
- [cilium](https://cilium.io): Internal Kubernetes networking plugin.
- [contour](https://projectcontour.io): Ingress controller.
- [external-secrets](https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets/): Managed Kubernetes secrets using [1Password Connect](https://github.com/1Password/connect).
- [rook](https://github.com/rook/rook): Distributed block storage for peristent storage.
- [sops](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/guides/mozilla-sops/): Managed secrets for Kubernetes.
- [volsync](https://github.com/backube/volsync): Backup and recovery of persistent volume claims.

### GitOps

[Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) watches my [kubernetes](./kubernetes/) folder (see Directories below) and makes the changes to my cluster based on the YAML manifests.

The way Flux works for me here is it will recursively search the [kubernetes/apps](./kubernetes/apps) folder until it finds the most top level `kustomization.yaml` per directory and then apply all the resources listed in it. That aforementioned `kustomization.yaml` will generally only have a namespace resource and one or many Flux kustomizations. Those Flux kustomizations will generally have a `HelmRelease` or other resources related to the application underneath it which will be applied.

[Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) watches my **entire** repository looking for dependency updates, when they are found a PR is automatically created. When some PRs are merged [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) applies the changes to my cluster.

### Directories

This Git repository contains the following directories under [kubernetes](./kubernetes/).

```sh
üìÅ kubernetes      # Kubernetes cluster defined as code
‚îú‚îÄüìÅ bootstrap     # Flux installation
‚îú‚îÄüìÅ flux          # Main Flux configuration of repository
‚îî‚îÄüìÅ apps          # Apps deployed into my cluster grouped by namespace (see below)
```

### Cluster layout

Below is a a high level look at the layout of how my directory structure with Flux works. In this brief example you are able to see that `authelia` will not be able to run until `glauth` and `cloudnative-pg` are running. It also shows that the `Cluster` custom resource depends on the `cloudnative-pg` Helm chart. This is needed because `cloudnative-pg` installs the `Cluster` custom resource definition in the Helm chart.

```python
# Key: <kind> :: <metadata.name>
GitRepository :: k8s-gitops
    Kustomization :: cluster
        Kustomization :: cluster-apps
            Kustomization :: cluster-apps-authelia
                DependsOn:
                    Kustomization :: cluster-apps-glauth
                    Kustomization :: cluster-apps-cloudnative-pg-cluster
                HelmRelease :: authelia
            Kustomization :: cluster-apps-glauth
                HelmRelease :: glauth
            Kustomization :: cluster-apps-cloudnative-pg
                HelmRelease :: cloudnative-pg
            Kustomization :: cluster-apps-cloudnative-pg-cluster
                DependsOn:
                    Kustomization :: cluster-apps-cloudnative-pg
                Cluster :: postgres
```
