## Overview

This repo holds all the state for my home kubernetes cluster. This is my humble homelab that I hope serves me well for learning purposes and run my home related services like home automation, ad blockers, etc

## Infratructure

This repo pairs with [homelab-infra](https://github.com/blackjid/homelab-infra) where the infrastructure where I run my homelab is declared using terraform.
